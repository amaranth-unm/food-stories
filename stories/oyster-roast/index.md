# South Carolina Oyster Roasts
This story is from Jared, who grew up on Folly Beach, a small island in South Carolina. As a teen, he spent most of his time surfing, eating seafood, and hanging out at the beach with his friends. He remembers oyster roasts fondly as a time to have fun and celebrate with all his loved ones.

## An Island-Wide Party
During the winter months, it’s common to have oyster roasts on the beach or the marshes, where people make a big bonfire, cover up pounds of oysters with burlap sacks to steam them, and enjoy the oysters, seafood, and beer with their family and friends. The cookouts can last for hours and, especially on a small island like Folly, were a chance for everyone to gather and connect, share stories and laughter, and engage in this ritual as a community.

## Analysis: How Rituals Create Community

While Jared loves oysters and eats them at any opportunity, what stands out to him most about these memories is the sense of family. On a small island where everybody knows everybody, your friends and neighbors become extended family. Oyster roasts bring a sense of ritual to a common food, and the meal itself may be forgettable, but it becomes special when everyone decides to come together at the same time to prepare and enjoy the feast.
He describes his friend’s first oyster roast as almost a rite of passage – oysters have a notoriously slimy texture, so eating an especially large one could be a point of pride or a chance for competition between friends. But even if it’s not eaten successfully, simply participating in the ritual serves as an initiation. He also describes how the host would allow the teenagers to drink as long as they stayed the night so he could watch over them, acting as a parental figure because it was such a small community. Jared and his family later took over hosting to carry on the tradition and teach the next generation.
These stories exemplify how food is used for tradition, culture, and belonging. People can feel like an insider once they participate in the accepted rituals (or foods) of the community, which gives them a sense of belonging. The oysters are valued in this case because of their regionality – this is one of the few places you can get them fresh, and it gives people a sense of cultural pride, and nostalgia for this food when they’re away from home.
