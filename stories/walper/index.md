# Public School Lunch
This story comes from Jace, who began his schooling journey at a charter school without a lunch program. In 3rd grade, he moved to New Mexico, where everyone got free school lunch.

## Trying new things
For the first 4 years of schooling, Jace's parents packed him lunch. Sometimes pizza rolls and other times leftovers from dinner. He always knew what to expect. Moving to a new school was scary enough, but the thought that the school lunch (and breakfast) was unpredictable was a new challenge. Even reading the menu was a gamble because the offering did not always match what was listed. The idea of this was exciting, and even if he didn't eat lunch, he had snacks at home.

## Analysis: food preferences, cultural adaptation, and the quality of public school meal programs

The transition from his previous school to his new school is one of new experiences and joining the community. This move introduced him to regional New Mexican cuisine, particularly red chili-based dishes like Frito pies and red chili enchiladas, which he embraced positively. The enthusiasm for these regional foods suggests successful cultural adaptation through food experiences.

Jace demonstrates clear food preferences with detailed sensory descriptions. His favorite items include New Mexican Frito pies (described as "spicy" and "savory"), bean-and-cheese burritos for breakfast, and spicy chicken sandwiches. He appreciates foods with bold flavors and texture. Conversely, he dislikes items he perceives as bland or of poor quality, such as Lucky Charms cereal (calling it "flavorless"), ham and cheese sandwiches with "slimy and weird" ham, and canned corn in the mashed potato bowls.

The schools offer a diverse range of options to students, from salads and pizza to rotating daily specials. They also introduce them to new foods such as jicama, described as "crunchy little sweet dirt sticks," and asian pears. Jace acknowledges this as a positive experience.
