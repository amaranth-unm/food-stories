# Encounters with the apple
by Rae (26, resident of Albuquerque, NM)

Find here three brief anecdotes in response to a prompt to share "any memorable experience with apples in one's life." Respondents are loved ones: Nino (34, resident of western Massachusetts), Scout (28, resident of NYC), and Dawood (30, roaming resident of all over).

## The mundane and the magical
These conversations feature takes on the apple that range from the quotidienne to the enlightening. Sometimes discussed in utilitarian terms, sometimes revered as a source of awe, the apple evoked thorough reply from every speaker. No conversation was confined to the gustatory realm. Yet, taste and texture remained a significant factor in my friends' articulation of their experience with apples...woe is the humble, mealy apple. All hail the *crisp*.

## A snack, a symbol, a spectacle?

The apple is at once a fruit of great simplicity and complication. Little red globe, fruit of *Malus domestica*, meat of pie, source of poison (both literal and literary), symbol of the pure and the pastoral, and poster-child of modern horticulture. These conversations speak to the roles apples can play in our lives and how these roles are shaped by both individual lived experience and a culturally-constructed consciousness. I myself fell in love with apples while living in The Big Apple, and they’ve since captivated my amusement as a good that is simultaneously omnipresent and entirely taken for granted. 

At the industrial level, apples are a ubiquitous commodity that many nations, subregions, and even states claim as identity. Nino speaks to the ways in which his move to Pennsylvania was immediately impressed by the state’s booming apple agribusiness, that visiting an orchard is “always something one can do” there. He recalls spending much of his time upon first arriving doing just that, apple-bobbing, and developing a habit of walking with apples in-hand. The latter became an exercise of *personal* identity - an individual identity shaped by its situation in a state that peddles apples as a sort of ideology, a source of pride. 


The story also reflects the idea of **embodied knowledge and generational transmission**. The pitmaster’s line about learning from his grandfather and letting “the meat tell you when it’s ready” shows that expertise here isn’t formal or codified; it’s experiential and relational. In class, we’ve talked about how food work often relies on skills that are undervalued or unrecorded — the kinds of knowledge passed along by doing, by apprenticeship, by memory. In this sense, barbecue exemplifies what we might call *vernacular expertise*: a tradition maintained through labor, observation, and care, rather than through institutional authority.

When the narrator mentions the regional sauces — vinegar, mustard, tomato — and notes that each corresponds to a different part of the South, the story expands into a meditation on **regional identity and historical layering**. As we’ve read, those variations aren’t just matters of taste but markers of geography, migration, and cultural blending. The acknowledgment of Indigenous and African roots gestures toward the deeper and often erased histories embedded in “Southern” foodways. What feels like a casual backyard gathering is, on another level, the product of centuries of adaptation, exchange, and inequality.

Finally, the closing reflection — that the barbecue was “bigger than one meal” and “about belonging” — aligns with our discussions about **food as cultural memory**. The student recognizes that what endures isn’t just the recipe or the flavor, but the shared experience: the smoke, the labor, the crowd, the sense of continuity. In that moment, the story illustrates how oral histories capture what archives often miss — the *ephemeral* parts of culture that make history feel alive. Through sound, emotion, and storytelling, this single barbecue becomes a microhistory of American food itself: regional yet shared, ordinary yet full of meaning.
